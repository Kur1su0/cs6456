- Makefile.qemu is the true makefile.
- After running in the qemu (using bash run_qemu.sh), "attempting to get el_val" will be printed and the program will hang.

- test.log contains the proof of entering el0, which is generated by running run_qemu.sh.
  - Line 1 & 2 shows the kernel successfully switchs to el0.
  - Line 3 shows that get_el is inaccessiable in el0 and cause an exception.

- Based on the boot.S-xzl2 and https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dai0527/a
- The src/boot.S is modified to switch from el2 (qemu) or el3 (raspi 3) into el0.

- src/Kernel.c is modified to test get_el()
